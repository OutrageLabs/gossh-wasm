# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The `main` branch is the actively supported branch for security fixes.

## Reporting A Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in `gossh-wasm`, please report it privately before public disclosure.

- Open a private security advisory in GitHub (preferred), or
- Contact the maintainers directly with:
  - affected version/commit,
  - impact summary,
  - reproduction details,
  - suggested remediation (if available).

Please do not publish proof-of-concept details until maintainers have had a reasonable opportunity to investigate and patch.

## Disclosure Process

1. Maintainers acknowledge receipt as soon as practical.
2. Issue is triaged and severity-assessed.
3. A fix is prepared and validated with regression tests.
4. A patched release is published with advisory notes.
